## Chat app only for two user
Two user can chat each other. I added only core functionality because of as a backend developer.

 - Django 
 - Channel
 - Redis
 - bootstrap 5
 - crispy for bootstrap 5

Feature:

 - Authentication
 - Two peoples room

So how can i add two user in same room. I use *cantor_pairing_equation* for making unique two numbers as a single number and two people join in same room. This number is always be unique.
Installation:
install all of these package and run.
